    //You scored 73 marks which is B grade.
    //where 73 is the input and B is calculated by the program.  Use the following table for computing the grades:

    //Marks         Grade
    //80 to 100	    A
    //60 to 79	    B
    //40 to 59	    C
    //0 to 40	    F
    //< 0  	        **Error**
    //> 100	        **Error**
